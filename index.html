        An evening after dinner, Maria, four years old, is enthusiastically playing with her dad’s little torch, while the little sister Anna, barely one year old, is sitting on the high chair next to the dinner table. Maria points the torch up and down, all around: in her mouth, in her father’s nose, to the camera… at some point she goes to Anna and starts inspecting with the torch all her facial holes.

Maria: Anna’s little nose…. is dirty! Anna’s little ear… is dirty too! And now, let’s have a look at the cheeks: And now, let’s check the neck …Ahh! Here there’s the Golietta!

Paolo: What is there?

Maria: The Go-li-et-ta!

Paolo: What Golietta?!

(The parents seem confused, they have never heard of such word)

Maria: There is the Golietta!

Paola: What is the Golietta Maria? Can you explain to us what it is?

(Maria runs around the dinner table and giggles, excited about her discovery)

Maria: The Golietta is something that is in your neck. The Golietta is something that is in your neck! It is a ball that is in your neck!

Paola: Ooh do you mean Adam’s apple?

Maria: No, only chubby people have the Golietta! People like my sister!

Paolo: But that is because she is a baby!

Maria: Anna has the GOLIETTA!
What my sister meant to say that evening while pointing at my chubby neck was doppio mento (double chin), but her creative mind of a four-years-old kid preferred calling it with a brand new special word that nobody had ever thought of before. After that night, the word became part of our unwritten-family-dictionary, among many other neologisms and catchphrases, and it can still come up today in our conversations and references. Similar trivial terms, together with dozens of different jokes, epithets, invented idioms and ways of saying, are deeply rooted in our household communication. I have never really questioned their role in our daily conversations, but recently realized how their existence is undeniably unique and pretty much unknown to the rest of the world. With time, the presence of these specific words started to appear in my eye as a bizarre yet at the same time natural presence. Stories and term have been the discreet background lullaby to my growing up.
	The Italian author Natalia Ginzburg, in her novel ‘Family Lexicon’ (1963), brilliantly portrays her family through the description of anecdotes and specific terminology. The book, which follows the members of a Jewish family throughout their lives under the fascist regime in Italy, does not merely frame Ginzburg’s personal family unit. In fact, the narration goes further: it is able to grasp and depict some of those frequent and relatable dynamics common in families. The stories she reports, no matter how significantly different they might be from our own personal ones, describe some typical tendencies among relatives. For example, the book refers to some of those archetypal characters families have: an authoritarian putative father, a very protective or apprehensive mother, children that are mama’s boys and others that are daredevils, the ones that are ungrateful and the ones that are present and emphatic. When reviewing Ginzburg’s novel in 1963, the well-known Italian writer Italo Calvino comments it by writing “Natalia Ginzburg, who set out by remembering her own family lexicon, the ways of saying of her parents and brothers, soon realized that what she was after was that mysterious thread that defines and binds this entity that we call family, the meaning and the rhythm that accompanies us through our lives even when we have grown away from the roof and from the table of our childhood”. The book reinforces the realization that personal stories fall in a scheme of wider narratives. The way family stories unravel through the events of human life, such as birth and death, show us that there is a sense of “universal resonance” in them. Quoting Fredric Jameson, an american literary critic and political theorist, “the telling of the individual story and the individual experience cannot but ultimately include the whole laborious process of the collectivity itself”.
